# Parked loose ends

## OSEA symbolic-execution tactic (planned twice, never built)
**Status:** parked 2026-07-01 (idea dates to v1 era)
**Context:** both `plans/osea_symbolic_exec.md` and the v2 plan
(src/obseq/obseq2.md: "add symbolic execution support for short OSEA
fragments early") call for automating `runN n s prog = Ok final`
goals: per-instruction step lemmas → `runN_step_succ` chaining →
an `osea_symbolic_exec` tactic. paper.md §6 argues the fragment-local
proof style makes exactly this automation plausible.
**Why parked:** never scheduled; the plan file predates v2 (it uses
`StartsAt`/`List.get?`, both dead in v2's code map — the locator story
is now `compileStmt_emitted_in_compProg` + `simp`).
**To resume:** v2 already has pieces: `runN_CStore_step`,
`step_Die_preserves_reg`, `runN_allDie_preserves`, `oseair_runN_add`.
Missing: step lemmas for the remaining instructions, the chaining
lemma, then the tactic. Payoff rises with copy/ref/proj work
(steps 5–6) — consider before, not after, those.
**Effort estimate:** ~1 day for lemma layer; tactic metaprogramming extra

## Step 4: regime-A already-mapped-local milestone — THE next step
**Status:** parked 2026-07-01
**Context:** close the n=1 slice of `const_write_resolved_simulation`
(dst = already-mapped local; fragment is just `[CStore NatTy [Dat v]
dstReg]`). Wire locator + `runN_CStore_step` + `writeThroughPtr_sim`;
discharge `h_le` (le_refl), `h_dom` and `PlaceRegReady` from
`LocalBindingSim`; ap/tag reconciliation is trivial for a local
(t' = ρt(resolved.tag) = resolved.tag under identity); reconstruct the
9-conjunct CompilerInv via `oseair_runN_add`.
**Why parked:** workflow only — user switched to another project. No
technical blocker; all prerequisites are proved. This is the confirmed
next step when obseq2 resumes.
**To resume:** start in const_write.lean:87 replacing the sorry for
the local case; validates the full reconstruction end-to-end with
minimal surface.
**Effort estimate:** ~half-day

## Steps 5–6: proj/deref + fresh-local regimes, then copy/ref
**Status:** parked 2026-07-01
**Context:** step 5 = `placeToRegChecked_run_sim` (run place fragment:
mem unchanged, PlaceRegReady with fresh borrow tag, sims preserved) —
unlocks proj/deref const-write AND is the main shared machinery for
the copy.lean/ref.lean sorries. Step 6 = regime B
(`const_write_fresh_local_simulation`): allocator correspondence,
identity-extension of ρa/ρt, sim monotonicity (only
`MemValSim.rename_mono` exists; SourceMemSim/LocalBindingSim analogs
needed).
**Why parked:** sequenced after step 4.
**To resume:** journal snapshot has the full plan; die-success
(`sb_die` after `useMut`) is the known deferred obligation.
**Effort estimate:** step 5 ~1-2 days; step 6 ~1 day
